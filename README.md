# You-Dont-Know-JS
Just some scripts to convert [You-Dont-Know-JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) to an epub file using pandoc. The scripts were hacked together and could do with improving, I'll probably update them at a later point in time. If you like the books then buy them (that's what I'm planning on doing but I want to read them first).
